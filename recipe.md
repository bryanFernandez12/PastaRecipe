1. Boil pasta
2. Turn on stove and heat up the red and white sauce together (The red sauce should be the base and then add the white sauce in after. You want to reach a somewhat dark orange color. Mix in enough sauce accordingly. The amount of sauce will vary for how much pasta you are going to prepare.)
3. When the sauces are mixed add in a little bit of heavy cream (if you want)
    Also add the spics and seasonings as well as the garlic cloves.
4. When the pasta is boiled perfectly to how you want it, drain and add the pasta in spoonfulls slowly to the sauce pan. So that it can all be mixed in together spoonfull at a time. If you dump all the pasta in with the sauce at once it wont be mixed that well.
5. Let it sit for a little while and keep mixing until you feel it is hot, mixed, and to the right consistency. 
6. Turn off the gas for the stove and enjoy!
